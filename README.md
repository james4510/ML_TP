### Business Objective
- Enhancing User Experience
    : analyze each userâ€™s reading preferences
- Providing Accurate and Efficient Recommendations 
    : By employing SVD, user-based, and item-based collaborative filtering models
  -->  Personalized reading experience

### Data Exploration
Goodbooks-10k Dataset:
- books_tag.csv: goodreads_book_id, tag_id, count
- books.csv: id, book_id, best_book_id, work_id, books_count, isbn13, authors, original_publication_year, original_title
- ratings.csv: book_id, user_id, rating
- tags.csv: tag_id, tag_name
- to_read.csv: user_id, book_id

Book Recommendation Dataset:
- Books.csv: ISBN, Book_Title, Book-Author, Year_Of-Publication, Publisher, Image-URL-S, Image-URL-M, Image-URL-L
- Ratings.csv: User-ID, ISBN, Book-Rating
- Users.csv: User-ID, Location, Age
### Data Preprocessing
Goodbooks-10k
- Remove unnecessary columns
- Merge ratings.csv, books.csv based on book_id
- Fill the missing values

Book Recommendation
- Remove unncessary columns
- Convert all string data to lowercase
- Merge Ratings.csv, Books.csv and Users.csv based on ISBN
- Delete noise data by eliminating data whose rating is 0.

Filtering
- Select books with 10 or more ratings
- Select books that have been rated by at least 5 different users.

Normalization
- Unify the column name of both data sets
- Change the data type of ISBN and User_ID
- Map the ISBN based on book title
- Fix the size of ISBN
- Exclude users only rated one book
- Exclude duplicated books of both dataset

### Modeling
- Implemented using Surprise library

SVD
- SVD is a dimensionality reduction technique that analyzes latent factors between users and items to generate recommendations
- Recommendations are generated based on the provided user ID  
- Output: displays the title of each recommended book and its predicted rating  

User-based
- User-Based Collaborative Filtering finds similar users based on Pearson correlation
- Recommends books that similar users have rated highly
- Output: provides a list of books with predicted ratings for the specified user
  
Item-based
- Item-Based Collaborative Filtering compares items to find similarities based on user ratings
- Books similar to those the user has already rated highly are recommended
- Output: generates a list of books with predicted ratings tailored to the specified user
